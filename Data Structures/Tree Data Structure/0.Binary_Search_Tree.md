Binary Search Trees (BSTs) follow specific rules that govern the organization of the tree and its nodes. Here are the key rules for a binary search tree:

1. **Binary Tree Structure**: A binary search tree is a binary tree, meaning each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. 

2. **Ordering Property**: For every node `n`, all nodes in the left subtree of `n` have values less than `n`, and all nodes in the right subtree of `n` have values greater than `n`. This property ensures that the tree is ordered in a way that allows for efficient searching.

3. **No Duplicates**: Binary search trees typically do not allow duplicate values. If a value is equal to an existing node's value, it is either ignored or inserted into a specific location depending on the implementation.
