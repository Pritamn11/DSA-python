Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. Here's a basic overview of how it works:

1. **Initialize**: Begin with the entire sorted array and set two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.
  
2. **Midpoint**: Calculate the midpoint of the array (index = (left + right) / 2).

3. **Compare**: Compare the target value with the value at the midpoint:
   - If the target value matches the midpoint value, the search is successful, and the index of the midpoint is returned.
   - If the target value is less than the midpoint value, the search continues on the left half of the array.
   - If the target value is greater than the midpoint value, the search continues on the right half of the array.
  
4. **Repeat**: Update the pointers based on the comparison results and repeat steps 2-3 until either the target value is found or the left pointer is greater than the right pointer (indicating that the target value is not in the array).


## The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array.
