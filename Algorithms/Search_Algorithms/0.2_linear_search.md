Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward algorithm used to find a target value within an unsorted array. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Start at the Beginning**: Begin with the first element of the array.

2. **Compare**: Compare the target value with the current element of the array:
   - If the target value matches the current element, the search is successful, and the index of the element is returned.
   - If the target value does not match the current element, move on to the next element in the array.

3. **Repeat**: Continue comparing the target value with each subsequent element in the array until either:
   - The target value is found, and its index is returned.
   - The end of the array is reached without finding the target value, in which case the search is unsuccessful.

4. **End of Array**: If the end of the array is reached without finding the target value, return a special value (often -1) to indicate that the target value is not present in the array.



Linear search is straightforward and easy to implement, but it can be inefficient for large arrays because it may need to examine every element in the array to find the target value. As a result, it's typically used for small datasets or when the array is unsorted and random access is not possible.


# The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
