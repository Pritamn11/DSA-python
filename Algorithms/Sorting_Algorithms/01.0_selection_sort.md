# Selection sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the element in the next position of the sorted portion. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. For example, let's consider sorting the list [5, 3, 8, 2, 1]. In the first iteration, the algorithm selects the smallest element, which is 1, and swaps it with the first element, resulting in [1, 3, 8, 2, 5]. In the second iteration, it selects the next smallest element, which is 2, and swaps it with the second element, yielding [1, 2, 8, 3, 5]. This process continues until the list is fully sorted, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]. The name "selection sort" reflects the algorithm's systematic approach of selecting elements and sorting them into their correct positions.

# Selection Sort Algorithm

1. Starting from the first element search for smallest/
(biggest) element in the list of numbers.
2. Swap minimum /(maximum) number with first element.
3. take the sublist(ignore sorted part) and repeat step 1
and 2 untill all the elements are sorted
