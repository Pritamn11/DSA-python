# Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. For example, consider sorting the list [5, 3, 8, 2, 1]. In the first pass, the algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary, resulting in [3, 5, 2, 1, 8]. It continues this process, swapping adjacent elements until the largest element "bubbles up" to the end of the list. After the first pass, the largest element, 8, is in its correct position. The algorithm then repeats the process for the remaining elements, gradually moving smaller elements to their correct positions. After subsequent passes, the list becomes increasingly sorted until no swaps are needed. The name "bubble sort" comes from the way larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each pass, similar to bubbles rising to the surface in a bubble bath.

Bubble Sort:
Some times referred as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm
which sorts n number of elements in the list by comparing the
each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in wrong
order.


Algorithm: (Ascending order)
1. Starting with the first element(index=0) compare the current
element with the next element of the list.
2. If the current element is greater than the next element of the
list swap them.
3. If the Current element is less than the next element, move to
the next element. Repeat step 1.
