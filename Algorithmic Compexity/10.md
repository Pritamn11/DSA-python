The Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or the complexity of a function. It provides an upper bound on the asymptotic growth rate of a function in terms of another function.

In simpler terms, Big O notation helps to analyze how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm increase as the size of the input grows. It expresses this growth rate in terms of the most significant term of the algorithm's runtime or space complexity function.

For example, if an algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the size of the input, we would say its complexity is O(n), where "n" represents the size of the input. If an algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size, its complexity would be O(n^2), and so on.

So, when we say an algorithm has a complexity of O(f(n)), it means that the algorithm's runtime (or space) is bounded by a function that grows no faster than f(n) as the input size increases.
