Of course, let's go through each line:

1. **want to evaluate program's efficiency when input is very big**:
   - We're interested in understanding how well a program performs when it's given a large amount of data to work with. This helps us anticipate how the program will behave in real-world scenarios where the input size is significant.

2. **want to express the growth of program's run time as input size grows**:
   - We're looking to describe how the time it takes for a program to run changes as the amount of input data increases. This helps us understand the relationship between the program's performance and the size of the input it's working with.

3. **want to put an upper bound on growth - as tight as possible**:
   - We aim to set a limit on how much the program's runtime can increase as the input size grows. We want this limit to be as accurate and precise as possible, providing a reliable estimate of the program's performance under varying input sizes.

4. **do not need to be precise: "order of" not "exact" growth**:
   - While we aim for accuracy, we don't necessarily require pinpoint precision. Instead, we focus on determining the general trend or order of magnitude of the program's runtime growth as the input size changes. We're interested in the broad pattern rather than precise measurements.

5. **we will look at largest factors in run time (which section of the program will take the longest to run?)**:
   - We identify the parts of the program that contribute the most to its overall runtime. By understanding which sections take the longest to execute, we can focus our optimization efforts on improving the performance of these critical areas.

6. **thus, generally we want tight upper bound on growth, as function of size of input, in worst case**:
   - In most cases, we're interested in establishing a close upper limit on how the program's runtime changes with respect to the input size, especially in scenarios where the program encounters the worst possible input data. This ensures that we have a realistic expectation of the program's performance under challenging conditions.
