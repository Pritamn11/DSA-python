A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 

Think of a queue as a line of people waiting for something, like at a movie theater or a supermarket checkout. The first person who joins the line is the first one to get served. This is called the "First-In-First-Out" (FIFO) principle.

Operations:
*Enqueue: Insert an element at the back of the queue.
*Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
*Peek (or Front): Return the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
*IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
*Size: Return the number of elements in the queue.

How does it work?
*Enqueue: When someone joins the line, they're added to the back of the queue. This operation is called "enqueueing."
*Dequeue: When it's someone's turn to be served, they're taken from the front of the line and served. This operation is called "dequeuing."
*Peek: You can also peek at the front of the line to see who's next to be served without removing them from the queue.
*IsEmpty: You can check if the queue is empty, meaning there's no one in line.*
Size: You can also find out how many people are in line.
